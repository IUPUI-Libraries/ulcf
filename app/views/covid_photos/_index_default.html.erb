    The IUPUI University Library is collecting digital images from anyone
    affiliated with the IUPUI-campus (students, staff, faculty) for the creation
    of the digital collection "IUPUI Community: Documenting Life During the
    Pandemic." This collection aims to document the impact that the Coronavirus
    pandemic has made to our daily lives. By sharing your images, you can help
    shape how future generations will understand these events.
